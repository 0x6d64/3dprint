## Advice for printing
## Advice for assembling
- The thread of the weight must not be too thick or too long. Both can lead to the winding being too thick on the spool. This can be an issue (e.g. torque being too high)
- the thread should not be too squishy, e.g. due to a thick soft material. This can lead to the weight dropping suddenly a little bit, this can tangle the string or maybe even damage the clock
- bearings must be degreased and oiled with thin oil before assembly

## Advice for hanging/tuning
