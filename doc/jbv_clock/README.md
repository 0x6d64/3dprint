# Building instructions for JBV 3d printed clock
Note: this document is a draft.


## Advice for printing
(wip)

## Advice for assembling
- The thread of the weight must not be too thick or too long. Both can lead to the winding being too thick on the spool. This can be an issue (e.g. torque being too high)
- the thread should not be too squishy, e.g. due to a thick soft material. This can lead to the weight dropping suddenly a little bit, this can tangle the string or maybe even damage the clock
- bearings must be degreased and oiled with thin oil before assembly

## Advice for hanging/tuning
- The clock has to be hung horizontally, and with more than 1 nail or screw. The weight will pull on the left side, and this can tilt the clock otherwise (and this messes up the calibration of the anchor)
