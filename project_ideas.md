# Project ideas
* a generic workflow to transform a vector graphic into a flat STL
  * bonus points: handle more than one color into different layers
* a marble run
* a PR counter that counts pull reviews with marbles based on the GitHub API
* learn how to extrude along paths properly and print big house numbers
* pen clips that go into notebooks
* soap molds
  * molds with a rim and a removable bottom to pour in
  * TPU moulds with a PLA case
  * positive PLA models that then get modeled into silicone negative moulds
