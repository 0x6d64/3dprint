# Project ideas
* a generic workflow to transform a vector graphic into a flat STL
  * libraries that can be used
    * https://pypi.org/project/csdt-stl-converter/
    * https://github.com/rmrao/img2stl
    * https://github.com/thearn/stl_tools
  * maybe use python wrapper around SCAD
  * bonus points: handle more than one color into different layers
  * application: room labels for work
* a marble run
* a PR counter that counts pull reviews with marbles based on the GitHub API
* learn how to extrude along paths properly and print big house numbers
* pen clips that go into notebooks
* soap molds
  * molds with a rim and a removable bottom to pour in
  * TPU moulds with a PLA case
  * positive PLA models that then get modeled into silicone negative moulds
* a "chain" to fix a marker to a fridge
* a customized LED light bar for the materials that I already have
