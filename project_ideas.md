# Project ideas
* a generic workflow to transform a vector graphic into a flat STL
  * libraries that can be used
    * https://pypi.org/project/csdt-stl-converter/
    * https://github.com/rmrao/img2stl
    * https://github.com/thearn/stl_tools
  * maybe use python wrapper around SCAD, see also [this folder](./tools/svg-to-3dprint)
  * bonus points: handle more than one color into different layers
  * application: room labels for work
* a marble run
* a PR counter that counts pull reviews with marbles based on the GitHub API
* learn how to extrude along paths properly and print big house numbers
* pen clips that go into notebooks
* soap molds
  * molds with a rim and a removable bottom to pour in
  * TPU moulds with a PLA case
  * positive PLA models that then get modeled into silicone negative moulds
* a "chain" to fix a marker to a fridge
* a customized LED light bar for the materials that I already have
* a printed holder for hex mirror tiles like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DF5W7L6/) in order to create a bent mirror.
  For an example project on reflecting light in a specific pattern
  see this: https://github.com/bencbartlett/3D-printed-mirror-array
* a printed LED desk lamp with a sleek mechanism to keep it
  in position
