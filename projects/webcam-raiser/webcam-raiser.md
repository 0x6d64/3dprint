A simple piece of plastic that raises a webcam to work with a screen that has only a thin bezel.

## Version history
- v3 (todo): round lips to make the lip invisible from the front, shorten the distance between lip and leg 0.5mm.
- v2: bigger lip that hooks over edge, beefier back part for the webcam to have more space to stand
- v1: initial version
